# weather-dashboard

##  Description
This site is a weather dashboard. It takes in 2 separate weather APIs to target the lat and lon by city name. Once a city name is typed into the search bar, the site will generate the current weather for that city including the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV Index. It will then generate a 5 day forecast with the same information (excluding UV Index). You will also be able to see an icon next to each day that is determined from the API's matching icon list.
